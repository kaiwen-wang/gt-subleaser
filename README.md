Quick project I did over the summer.

Areas of improvement included styling, working with forms, communicating with a backend, and thinking about the business area and what people need to sublease things.

Ultimately, I got busy with school and didn't have time to build it into a big platform and felt like Facebook groups served this purpose well enough.

In the future, I'd probably try to host Postgres directly instead of using Supabase.

I found it difficult to structure the project as it got bigger, such as figuring out where to put the backend handlers.

I found styling Next's `Image` to be particularly annoying because you couldn't apply styles easily as it's its own component.

I might work with a different state management in the future, but useContext worked well enough in this case. I am not leaning toward Redux due to my previous experiences with it.
