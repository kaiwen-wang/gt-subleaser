It really seems like there's no critical mass of apartments anywhere.

**Goal**: corner GT market completely.

**Issue**: Does too many subleases crowd out people's desire to post there? nah, critical mass makes it more likely to be used

"Compared to the broader housing market, college rentals are unique in that many units are booked a semester or more in advance. Furthermore, even when listings are available, they can typically only be found on campus bulletin boards or by walking around a college town and looking for “for rent” signs. All of that can make it difficult for students to find housing, especially on short notice."

People don't care about subleasing to other students. They only care about getting the money. So no need to limit things to student only, unless they want to piss off their roommates.

"Cribspot hopes to change that, by creating the most comprehensive search engine for apartments on or near university campuses. It’s doing that by collecting rental information from thousands of different sources and working directly with landlords who don’t have websites or other ways to find out about their apartments"

What's different now:

- the technology space is different. It's much easier for a single person to build quickly given that they use the right tools

How to make money:

- Promote your own post (possible cause some students are desperate to get out of their lease)
- Get notifications when new posts come out matching your criteria (searchers)
- Let local landlords or apartment complexes advertise (idk because the demand probably outstrips demand around campus)
- Partner with companies in the Atlanta area that have major internship programs
- Charge external people to be able to create an account and see listings (idk if you wanna introduce this variability of non-students, the thing is students want to sublease their place to no matter whom)

How to advertise:

- Posters around school
- Major mailing lists
- News
- Freshman
- Clubs/tabling is probably not a good use of my time
- Transfer student seminar
- Winter graduates
- List of all people interning in a semester

Easiest default:

- Winter gradutes X Spring transfers
- Everyone X Summer interns

Problems:

- leasing to off-campus people
- If people can directly contact someone, do they know where the leasing is coming from?

List of schools to target:

- GT -> Emory -> Georgia State/UGA/Kennesaw (suburban schools may have different rental markets or features)

0 -> 1 -> 2

Zero to one is the hardest.
